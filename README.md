# Deep-learning-with-python-notebooks
Repo contains all the jupyter notebook code samples that were found in DL with python book (Manning Publication).

# Quick Run 
The easiest way to run the code is to download the .ipynb file and upload it to Colab. Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. The hosted runtime already includes the following dependencies:

Numpy
Tensorflow
Matplotlib
which are all we need to run CNPs.

Alternative you can open the .ipynb file using Jupyter notebook. If you do this you will also have to set up a local kernel that includes Tensorflow.

# Purpose:
The soul purpose of this repo is to revise and strengthen all my DL concept.As well to provide a check list so as to run through all the necessary DL concepts that are required to be known.
